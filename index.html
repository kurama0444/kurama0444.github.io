                <p>I'm an empathetic individual, always striving to prioritize others' needs. I identify as Apogender, AMAB, and my pronouns are they/them, though any are acceptable. I'm also sex-repulsed and romance-repulsed AroAce.</p>
                <p>Music is a vital lifeline for me, a constant companion through life's intricate journey.</p>

                <h2>Eating & ARFID</h2>
                <p>Living with ARFID means a very limited diet, primarily "junk food" like specific cookies, ice cream, and candy. "Normal" foods are a challenge.</p>
                <p>I've learned to navigate social situations, no longer hiding my eating habits, though I still prefer to avoid watching others eat or food scenes in media.</p>
                <p>A past traumatic experience at school led to a daily supply of crackers, highlighting the unique challenges ARFID presents.</p>

                <h2>My Environment</h2>
                <p>I currently live in an emotionally abusive household, experiencing daily guilt-tripping, invalidation, neglect, and emotional abuse. This environment often leads to selective mutism under stress.</p>
                <p>Despite these challenges, I continue to seek growth and understanding.</p>
